The *Data Highlights* section of the SciLifeLab Data Platform showcases exceptional recently published open datasets and open source tools which could be useful for data-driven life science research or research results based on such datasets and tools. The highlights are written by the SciLifeLab Data Platform editorial team or external contributors. If you would like for your own research data or tool to be featured or if you would like to suggest someone else's work, feel free to send us a suggestion using the form above.

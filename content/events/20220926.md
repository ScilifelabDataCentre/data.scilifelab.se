description: "This intense one-week course (open to PhD students, post-docs, and other researchers affiliated to Swedish academia and healthcare) provides an introduction to the analysis of next generation sequencing data. Lectures on the theory of concepts will be paired with practical computational exercises in the Linux environment. The practical exercises will focus on data from the Illumina platform, but we will discuss other sequencing platforms and the advantages and challenges to using their data during the lectures."

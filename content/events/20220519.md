description: "This symposium aims to bring together experts from various fields with the explicit goal of outlining a joint worldwide strategy to obtain a structural map of the human proteome. In addition to determining the structure and composition of all human proteins and their interactions, it would also require understanding the flexible and dynamic supra-molecular structures in living cells, such as multi-component membraneless organelles. A few key findings from the last years make us believe that this goal is achievable. First, detailed knowledge of composition (splice forms, PTMs) and expression levels in different cells are becoming available. Secondly, Cryo-EM has revolutionized the structural determination of large protein complexes. Finally, using co-evolution and advances in deep learning, it is now possible to predict the structure of many individual proteins and complexes directly using no other information than the sequences and their evolutionary history. In the next few years, combining the progress in these three areas will provide an opportunity to provide unprecedented molecular insights into the function of cells. Theoretical methods combined with ever-increasing sequence information will enable an understanding sequence and structural variation within populations, both in humans and in disease-causing organisms."

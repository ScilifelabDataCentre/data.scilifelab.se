description: "Life science research is becoming increasingly dependent on data, and never before has so much data been generated today. The amount and complexity increase exponentially, and when this data becomes open to researchers around the world, more scientific discoveries are made possible. The rapid technological development in life sciences, combined with innovations in computing and AI, will play an increasingly important role in research and development and affect virtually all areas of medicine and science.

During this day, you will meet prominent international and local researchers, take part in current research, and discuss open data, AI, ethics, and visualization related to life science."

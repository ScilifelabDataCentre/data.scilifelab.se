description: "The current COVID-19 pandemic has understandably received considerable attention worldwide over the last few years. As it spread across the globe, the pandemic posed significant challenges for society, governmental bodies, healthcare systems, and research communities. Unprecedented efforts were necessary to  generate, handle, and report the sheer amount of complex data required to be able to understand how SARS-CoV-2 was spreading, and develop efficient policies to fight the pandemic.

SciLifeLab Data Centre, ELIXIR Norway and ELIXIR Estonia have organised an online event exploring how Nordic countries handled omics data related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We invite bioinformaticians, data stewards, research scientists, and anyone else interested in this topic to attend. We will focus in particular on how sequencing efforts were coordinated, how data was managed and shared, and how data was used and communicated to different groups. We will also discuss the importance of the FAIR principles in pandemic data management, and which tools and pipelines facilitated efforts. We hope that this will shed light on best practices that could be adopted across the Nordics for future pandemics, and how we might best prepare for them. We also hope to identify key resources that have wider applicability and can be reused further."

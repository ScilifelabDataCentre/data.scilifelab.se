description: "The summer school is aimed at graduate students, post-docs, and young independent investigators who want to learn about new techniques to explore the proteins encoded by the human genome. The course will teach state-of-the-art analysis of the human proteins with a focus on antibody-based methods, transcriptomics and mass spectrometry. The course will have several daily lectures by experts in the field and this will be complemented with workshops in which the participants will annotate genes/proteins. Each participant will take part in an annotation effort with the aim to go through all experimental evidence of the respective protein and to evaluate the quality of the underlying data to score the evidence for protein profiles and functionality."

title: WASP-DDLS Postdoc in AI and Machine Learning
type: Job
app_deadline: 2022-09-30
employer: Chalmers

description: "The announced postdoc position is part of a joint collaboration between the two largest research programs in Sweden, the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) and the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS), with the ultimate goal of solving ground-breaking research questions across disciplines.
<br><br>
This position is part of the twin-postdoctoral research project “Massively parallel in vivo gene editing and AI modeling to decipher brain tumor invasion”. The WASP post-doctoral researcher (this position) will join Rebecka Jörnsten’s group at Chalmers and the DDLS post-doctoral researcher has recently joined the Nelander lab at Uppsala University.
<br><br>
We are looking for a motivated, independent postdoctoral and team-oriented researcher in AI and machine learning eager to work on the development of new methodologies and computing solutions to analyze complex, high-dimensional data. The project involves both real-world data analysis and new methods’ development. The key analytical challenge in this project is to analyze a new type of massively parallel gene knockout experiments in the context of brain tumor studies. Towards this goal, you will develop methods for neural network regularization appropriate for the analysis of noisy data and algorithms for optimal experimental design, as well as data augmentation and transfer learning methods to combine heterogeneous data sources.

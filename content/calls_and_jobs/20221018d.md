description: "As a member of the Kutter lab, you will apply and optimize novel transcriptomic approaches (based on bulk and single cell RNA profiling) to study gene regulation and RNA processing using mammalian systems (primary tissues and cell lines), carry out validation experiments involving biochemical and molecular biological tools, and participate in the general duties of the team. As a research assistant you will take a strong lead in the project design and management as well as data generation, analyses and interpretation, and collaborate with other team members. You are expected to report the scientific results by writing scientific papers, attending scientific meetings, and effectively communicate with peers. The ability to work in a highly interdisciplinary and international environment, and to engage in continuous professional development is a must.

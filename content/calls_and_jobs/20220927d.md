description: "Establish the knowledge and workflow to run proteomic experiments in the lab in collaboration with a local proteomic core facility. Adapt hyperLOPIT to red algae. Bring red algal cultures to sufficient densities, and execute hyperLOPIT. Perform protein cellular location prediction by Machine Learning. Analyse the data in the context of plastid evolution. Disseminate results in appropriate formats, including leading peer-reviewed publications and conferences. Training of junior group members might also be involved, as well as other standard tasks related to a research group including providing operational support to the good functioning of the lab. The candidate should be willing to travel, for short (e.g. conference) or longer period if training is necessary."

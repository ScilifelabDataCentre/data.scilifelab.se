description: "The main focus of this PhD position will be to develop AI models and/or other modeling approaches with the aim to predict the biodiversity capacity/potential of a given site. Although biodiversity is very complex, a good starting point is to focus on species richness or richness on other taxonomic levels. The training data for these models will be biodiversity data generated within our group as well as by local and international collaborators, largely consisting of genetic data resulting from environmental DNA sequencing. Sample datasets for initial development work are ready to be compiled and analyzed immediately. Predictors used in these models will consist of biotic as well as abiotic features, including high-resolution data generated by modern remote sensing techniques (e.g., satellite images and airborne laser scanning data)."

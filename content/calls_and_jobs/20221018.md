description: "The DDLS program will focus on four strategic areas of data-driven research: cell and molecular biology, evolution and biodiversity, precision medicine and diagnostics, epidemiology and infection biology. The first 20 junior group leaders to join the DDLS Fellows program are now recruited to different Swedish universities.
<br><br>
Each DDLS Fellow will receive a recruitment package of 17 MSEK, which is meant to cover 5 years of his/her own salary, two PhD students and two postdoc positions, as well as running costs. The Fellow positions are tenure-track, and the universities/organizations will assume the long-term responsibility of their support as tenured faculty.
<br><br>
The subject area cell and molecular biology concerns research that fundamentally transforms our knowledge about how cells function by peering into their molecular components in time and space, from single molecules to native tissue environments. This research subject area aims to lead the development or application of novel data-driven methods relying on machine learning, artificial intelligence, or other computational techniques to analyze, integrate and make sense of cell and molecular data.
<br><br>
At Stockholm University the Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute is looking to fill a position as DDLS fellow in data driven cell and molecular biology."

description: "We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with background in infectious disease modeling, population biology, applied mathematics or game theory. The work will focus on the simulation of coordinated international interventions between countries to reduce antimicrobial resistance. The ideal candidate will also bring his/her own research questions to develop in the broad field of disease dynamics. The successful candidate will work independently (i) to run epidemics simulations (ii) conduct sensitivity analysis, (iii) conduct parameter inference."

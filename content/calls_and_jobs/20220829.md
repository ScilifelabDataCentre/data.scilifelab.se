description: "
Artificial intelligence (AI) is at the core of modern-day applications. With the advent of massive datasets, the last two decades were dedicated to improve the mathematical modeling and training processes. Recently, a significant extent of the research focus has shifted towards security, privacy and trust of AI-assisted solutions. Among the recently developed solutions, federated machine learning (FedML) has proven to be a suitable approach for privacy-preserving machine learning.
<br><br>
The main objective of federated machine learning is to train a global machine learning model based on data that is distributed across heterogeneous data providers, but without requiring the raw data to leave the local data provider. While the FedML paradigm has been shown to preserve confidentiality of the data between the local data providers and the global model aggregator, there are still open challenges in ensuring that the training process is secure and private against malicious data providers, as well as to monitor the integrity of the training process without having access to the local data.
<br><br>
In this project, our focus will be on security and privacy-enhancing techniques for federated machine learning. The approach is centered around developing new theories and methodologies to achieve secure aggregation of federated machine learning models."

description: "We are looking for 1-2 experts that will participate primarily in bioinformatics analysis of omics data in medically or clinically oriented studies, but also other types of bioinformatics analyses. The work involves supporting Swedish researchers in this field under a “fee for service” model. The projects will differ in complexity and will typically involve human data in the health and clinical area, but can in some cases involve data from other organisms, as well as other research fields.
<br><br>
Responsibilities include planning, initiating and executing bioinformatics analyses, communication with research groups, staying aware of current developments in the field, and writing and communicating results and reports. NBIS experts are also regularly involved in advanced bioinformatics training for the Swedish research community. Regular internal meetings and training opportunities will be part of the work. NBIS also gives time for professional development and the opportunity to learn from a diverse team of NBIS colleagues.
<br><br>
The work will include some amount of travel to other Swedish universities, as knowledge exchange is a key aspect of our operation and development, to maintain cutting-edge expertise for analysis of current and emerging data types."

description: "These postdoctoral positions in mass spectrometric chemical biology and metabolomics for microbiome investigation are available in the laboratory of Associate Professor Daniel Globisch. The Globisch laboratory is an international and multidisciplinary research group. Our research focus lies on the development of new methodologies to enhance the scope of quantitative and qualitative metabolomics-based research to simplify the discovery of disease-specific small molecule biomarkers in human samples (Example literature: Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 23232-23240; 2020, 59, 14342; 2018, 57, 13805; 2021; Chem. Sci. 2018, 9, 6233; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013, 110, 4218). This highly interdisciplinary project will include newly developed techniques at the interface of Chemistry and Biology with a combination of metabolomics-based analysis, mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites in biological samples, metabolic pathway analysis, and Chemical Biology techniques. Our team is currently searching for a highly motivated and enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers with passion and enthusiasm for science to support our ongoing interdisciplinary research projects to identify metabolic biomarkers and elucidate microbiome metabolism using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics."

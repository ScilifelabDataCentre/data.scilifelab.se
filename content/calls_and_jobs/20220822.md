description: "
With this position we plan to strengthen our activities in distributed, parallel and data-intensive computation and their applications. Examples of research in the area at the division include development of new programming models and frameworks for task-based parallelism, federated machine learning, new frameworks for distributed and cloud-based analysis of streaming data, large-scale parallel numerical linear algebra, optimization and simulation with applications in, e.g., computational chemistry, systems biology, genetics and computational fluid dynamics.
<br><br>
The vision of the division is a dynamic research environment where system and programming aspects close to computer science are integrated with improvements of computational methods close to applied mathematics. The research at the division is often motivated by an interest in the scientific application and in the (re)formulation of mathematical models to enable large-scale and scalable simulation and data analysis. For this reason, we value experience from interdisciplinary scientific collaborations and collaboration with industry."

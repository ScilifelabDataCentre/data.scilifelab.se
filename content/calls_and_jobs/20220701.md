description: "Because of privacy concerns around user data, and related legislation around handling user data, there has been an increased interest in using edge devices such as mobile phones, to process user data without storing them at a central location. This has also been a major concern in privacy-sensitive areas such as in medical applications of machine learning, where sharing patient data between hospitals raises privacy issues since patient data virtually always contain private information. There has therefore been much interest lately in federated learning, a class of optimization algorithms used mainly to train a global machine learning model at disparate heterogeneous sites without sharing data between the sites. It is possible to frame federated learning as an operator splitting problem, and within the operator splitting framework, it is possible to simultaneously solve many of the problems that arise when training large-scale machine learning models on e.g., medical images or other data from multiple sites."

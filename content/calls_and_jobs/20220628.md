description: "The focus of this PhD position will be to apply and further develop existing environmental DNA sampling and processing techniques, with the aim to comprehensively capture the biodiversity at a given site across the whole tree of life. This work will take place in collaboration with other research groups specialized in environmental DNA, both based at Uppsala University as well as at other national and international institutions. Depending on the candidateâ€™s background and interest, the PhD position may include the following tasks: i) testing combinations of different eDNA sampling techniques in the field, ii) developing lab-protocols to extract and amplify genetic markers for multiple organism groups from eDNA samples, iii) developing bioinformatic pipelines to automatically process, catalogue, and analyze samples (in collaboration with the [SBDI ASV portal](https://asv-portal.biodiversitydata.se/about), iv) compiling diversity metrics based on taxonomic as well as genetic diversity. In case of multiple suitable applicants, up to two applicants with complementary backgrounds may be accepted for this call."

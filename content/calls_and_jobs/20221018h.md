description: "The duties mainly consist of follow-up of small molecules identified through the screening of libraries of thousands of small molecules. This includes the identification of pre-existing substances by searching different types of databases, but mainly the design and synthesis of new small molecules with different substitution patterns. New small molecules will be characterized and the work should be summarized and communicated to the research group with whom the infrastructure cooperates. In addition to this, lab journals should be kept and joint efforts to keep the lab operations running are also part of the tasks with specific responsibilities e.g. for HPLC and MS instruments. Contact and exchange with researchers and with CBCS staff at other universities is an important part of the tasks. In addition, you are expected to take an active part in the development of the infrastructure through the implementation of new technologies and instrumentation."

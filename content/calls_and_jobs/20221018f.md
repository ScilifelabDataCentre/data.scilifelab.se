description: "The biodiversity of microbes is known to be extraordinarily high but most species remain uncultivated and we therefore know very little about their evolution and functioning in ecosystems. In this 2-year funded post-doc project, we will develop a microfluidic-assisted cell-sorting method that aims to isolate specific microbial cells from a mixed population in order to retrieve their genome in a targeted fashion.
<br><br>
<b>Duties</b>
<br><br>
Establish and maintain algal cultures to run experiments. Developing PCR assays to target specific cells via, e.g., TaqMan probes. Use this PCR assay in microdroplets, produced via microfluidic devices, and sort target droplets via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Perform all controls necessary to verify the proper functioning of the targeted assay. Prepare cell materials for high-throughput sequencing and analyse the resulting data. Regularly present data to both hosting labs and disseminate results in leading peer-reviewed publications and one conference. The training of junior group members (i.e. master and PhD students) might also be required as well as minor contributions to teaching."

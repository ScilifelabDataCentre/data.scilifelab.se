description: 'Your studies in Bioinformatics will be in the project: "Deep Learning for Protein-Protein interactions‚Äù.
<br><br>
Protein structure is essential for understanding their function as well as for developing drugs targeting proteins. Recently, a deep learning method that can predict the structure of most proteins was made freely available, and a database with predicted structure was released. However, proteins do not act alone - they act together with other proteins. Therefore, the next major challenge is to use these types of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions. Initial studies from us have shown that it is possible to predict accurate structures of a large part of dimeric proteins using either a modified version of AlphaFold2 or AlphaFold-multimer. However, there are still many proteins that cannot be built accurately, nor are we able always to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs and to build larger complexes accurately is still an unsolved problem. In this project, we are recruiting 1-2 PhD students which will work together with two recently recruited postdocs to leverage recent advances in the field of machine learning to build better deep-learning models for predicting protein-protein interactions and to apply these methods to biologically relevant problems.

The Elofsson group is located at the Science for Life Laboratory. Elofsson has worked on protein structure predictions for more than two decades. He has worked on various techniques, both using machine learning and other computational techniques. His most important contributions for this work are the methods he has developed to identify the quality of protein models, Pcons and various versions of ProQ. The group consists currently of five PhD students and one senior researcher.'

title: PhD student in medical cell biology specialized in advanced microscopy and image analysis
type: PhD position
app_deadline: 2022-09-15

description: 'The PhD student project aims to implement a super-resolution technique known as image scanning microscopy combined with spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Routines for image scanning, reconstruction and analyses must be developed to increase the spatial resolution while maintaining a high acquisition speed for imaging of cells and islets in three dimensions as a function of time. The method will be applied in studies of the primary cilium and signalling in this and other subcellular compartments. Signalling with calcium ions and cyclic nucleotides is of special interest. Fluorescent sensors for these messengers will be expressed with specific targeting sequences and the importance of various receptors and signalling proteins determined by pharmacological and molecular biological perturbations. The project will include technical work to build the microscope setup, programming to develop image acquisition routines and analysis methods, as well as experimental laboratory work with living cells in culture.
<br><br>
The project will be linked to the recently started research school within Uppsala Diabetes Center, UDC (https://www.uu.se/forskning/udc/?languageId=1) and involves supervisors from both medical (Anders Tengholm and Olof Idevall, Dept Medical Cell Biology) and technical-natural sciences faculty (Carolina WÃ¤hlby, Dept information technology and SciLifeLab BioImage Informatics facility, BIIF) with complementary competences in cell biology and physiology, microscopy of living cells and development of software and analysis tools for quantitative microscopy.
<br><br>
The successful candidate will devote most of the time towards the research project and own graduate studies. Other service activities within the department, such as teaching and administrative work, can be included within the framework of the employment (maximum 20%). The position will be extended with the time devoted to teaching to allow four years of full-time graduate studies.'

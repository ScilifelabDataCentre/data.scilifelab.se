description: "As a member of the Kutter lab, you will apply, optimize and integrate novel transcriptome-wide approaches (based on single cell RNA-sequencing) to study transcript regulation using data obtained from mouse studies and patients. This project focusses on the roles of regulatory RNAs. 
<br><br>
The Kutter lab interrogates genome- and transcriptome-wide regulation and functionality by employing a combination of next generation sequencing technologies (both bulk and single-cell) and high-throughput genetic screening approaches, develops computational methods, along with applying experimental techniques. The group uses an integrative and collaborative approach, works closely with computational and experimental groups at KI, Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab), and other local and international research groups. Frequent courses are provided on campus. Additional professional training is available through summer schools and recurrent workshops.
<br><br>
The laboratory is located at SciLifeLab on the Karolinska Institute campus in Stockholm. SciLifeLab offers an attractive research environment, provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and core facilities, and is home to the second largest sequencing cluster in Europe. SciLifeLab is a joint effort between Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, and Stockholm University. It hosts research groups with diverse backgrounds and expertise, creating a unique interface between basic biology, genomics, bioengineering, drug discovery, and translational medicine."

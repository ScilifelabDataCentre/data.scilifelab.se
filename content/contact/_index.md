Both the web portal and technical platform associated with the SciLifeLab Data Platform are maintained by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. We welcome contributions, suggestions, and questions related to the possibility of hosting tools/databases, and web portal content.

The web portal aims to showcase and promote services and research related to data-driven life science in Sweden, as well as relevant events, training, and community-driven initiatives. The content of the portal is moderated by the team behind the SciLifeLab Data Platform, but we welcome contributions from the community in any of the above areas. For example, you can suggest [a data highlight](/highlights/), [an event](/events/), or [a training opportunity](/events/). Please do not hesitate to suggest your own research and/or events, as well as those of your colleagues. We'd also be happy to receive suggestions about other types of content.

Please also feel free to ask any questions that you might have regarding computational tools and databases for data-driven life science research, and data management practices.

You can get in touch with us about any of the above, either by emailing us at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se), or filling in the form below.

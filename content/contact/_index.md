The SciLifeLab Data Platform technical platform as well as this overarching web portal are maintained by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. We welcome contributions, suggestions, and questions related to both service hosting and content of the web portal. You can email us at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) or simply fill out the form below.

The SciLifeLab Data Platform web portal aims to showcase and promote: services for data-driven life science research in Sweden, research from researchers affiliated with a Swedish research institute or university, relevant events and training, and community-driven initiatives. The content of the web portal is moderated by the platform team but provided by the community. For example, you can suggest [a data highlight](/highlights/), [an event](/events/), or [a training opportunity](/events/) using the forms in the corresponding sections. Do not hesitate to suggest your own research and events as well as those of your colleagues. Do you have suggestions for other types of content that we should include? We are happy to receive such suggestions as well.

In addition, the team behind the SciLifeLab Data Platform is happy to either answer your questions or direct you to the best place to get your questions answered regarding computational tools and databases for data-driven life science research and research data management practices.

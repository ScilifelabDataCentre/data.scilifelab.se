### Can you introduce yourself and your current research focus?

_Golnaz Taheri_: My name is Golnaz Taheri and I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of EECS (Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science)/Division of CST (Computational Science and Technology) and a DDLS Fellow at SciLifeLab.
I work in the field of computational biology, with a focus on applying machine learning to cancer biology and drug
interaction prediction. My research involves analyzing multi-omics data and developing computational models to better
understand complex biological systems, especially related to female cancers.
I also work on creating systematic frameworks for predicting drug interactions, aiming to improve the quality of life
for patients dealing with multiple diseases, especially elderly individuals.

_Gisele Miranda_: I am an Assistant Professor in machine learning for computational biology at KTH. I am also a
SciLifeLab Fellow and an Imaging Scientist of the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. My research focuses on using machine
learning to understand cellular behaviour and interactions. I work extensively with imaging data and develop methods to
extract meaningful biological insights from complex datasets.

### Can you describe what Open Science means to you?

_Golnaz Taheri_: To me, Open Science is about making research and data accessible, transparent, and collaborative. It goes
beyond just sharing data; It involves using practices that allow others to reuse and build upon scientific work in an
ethical, responsible, and sustainable manner. Open Science enables a more inclusive research ecosystem by removing
barriers to knowledge sharing. It also promotes reproducibility, transparency, and integrity in science, which
ultimately leads to better, faster advancements in knowledge.

_Gisele Miranda_: To me, Open Science is fundamentally about transparency, being clear and open about how we
conduct research. But it’s also about collaboration and accessibility. Open Science enables the
research community to build on each other’s work, which accelerates progress. My first real
experience with structured Open Science came through an international grant that placed
strong emphasis on FAIR. As part of the project, all outputs, such as data, code, and
workflows, were expected to be made publicly available, unless they involved sensitive
information. It was also my first time working within such an international and collaborative
research community. That experience was eye-opening as it changed the way I think about
research, encouraging me to plan for FAIR outputs from the very beginning and to consider
how to make my work as reusable and impactful as possible.

### How have you implemented Open Science in your work? (E.g., open data, code sharing, preprints, FAIR principles, etc.)

_Golnaz Taheri_: I have implemented Open Science in several ways in my work. I share non-sensitive data openly through
accessible repositories, following the FAIR principles to ensure that others can easily access and use it. I also share
code for my computational tools and models through platforms like GitHub, enabling others to replicate or build upon my
work. Additionally, I have contributed to preprints, making my findings publicly available before formal peer review to
speed up the sharing of knowledge. However, I strongly believe that sharing data is crucial for scientific progress,
but it’s equally important to do so with ethical considerations in mind. This means ensuring that data is shared
ethically, respecting privacy, and making sure that sensitive information is protected. Ethical data sharing not only
promotes collaboration but also builds trust within the scientific community and with the public. In my work, I make
sure that any data shared is properly anonymised, and I follow the necessary guidelines to ensure it’s being shared in
a way that respects all ethical standards.

_Gisele Miranda_: With a background in computer science, sharing code has always been a natural part of my
work. We regularly use platforms like GitHub to share tools, which also prompts important
discussions about licensing and how others can reuse and build upon our work.
I’ve also brought Open Science principles into my teaching. For example, in the recent years I
led the image analysis module in the microscopy course organised by the Live Cell Imaging
facility at KI, for which we have generated a training dataset and a workshop specifically for
educational purposes. There’s been a lot of interest from the community, so we’re now
working on publishing this material in a more FAIR-compliant format.
While I don’t often generate raw data myself, I work extensively with data already generated
by the research community, and ensuring those are available for reuse is a key priority.

### What were the biggest benefits or outcomes of sharing your work openly? (Did it lead to new collaborations, reuse of your data, or public engagement?

_Golnaz Taheri_: Sharing my work openly has been incredibly beneficial in terms of collaboration and data reuse. With the
resources available through SciLifeLab, like Berzelius, NBIS, and Bianca, my data is accessible to the broader scientific
community, which has led to new collaborations and the reuse of my data by researchers worldwide. The open access nature
of the Swedish research environment, especially with support for journal publication fees, has made it easier for my work
to be widely shared and engaged with by others.
Moreover, the ability to share both my data and computational tools has enabled my research to have a greater impact,
with multiple groups building upon my work in cancer biology. These collaborations have been key in advancing my
research and helping me tackle more complex challenges.

_Gisele Miranda_: Sharing our work has significantly increased its visibility and made it easier for others to reuse.
It has also helped us connect with researchers working on similar challenges. By making our tools and datasets
accessible, others can adapt them to their needs and cite them, which not only extends the impact of our work but also
adds academic value through recognition and reuse.
Open sharing also aligns well with the expectations of many funders. For example, the grant source I mentioned earlier
has clear requirements around data sharing and making outputs FAIR. These guidelines have been helpful in structuring
our work more thoughtfully and ensuring that what we produce is accessible and meaningful to others.

### Did you face any challenges in doing Open Science, and how did you deal with them? (Practical, academic culture, technical, etc.)

_Golnaz Taheri_: While the benefits of Open Science are clear, there are certainly challenges. One of the practical challenges
I’ve faced is ensuring that my data and code are properly documented and organised so that they can be used by others. This can be
time-consuming and requires discipline, especially when working with large, complex datasets. Moreover, it’s crucial to
ensure that the data is shared ethically, with consideration for privacy and consent, so that it doesn't inadvertently
harm individuals or communities.
Another challenge is the academic culture, as some researchers may still hesitate to share their work openly due to
concerns about intellectual property or the fear that others might misuse their data. To overcome this, I emphasise the
importance of collaboration and transparency in my field. I also actively promote the idea that data sharing must be
done ethically (respecting privacy, rights, and integrity) so that the scientific community can work together in a
responsible way. By doing so, I believe that we can support faster scientific progress while ensuring the integrity
of both the research and the individuals involved.

_Gisele Miranda_: One of the main challenges has been the additional time and care required to prepare outputs,
such as data, code, and documentation, for public release. Ensuring that these materials are
clear, well-structured, and reusable takes effort, especially when taking into account questions
related to formatting and licensing. While there isn’t always a single solution, aligning with
community standards and learning from peers has been very helpful.
Another consideration is when working with processed rather than raw data, you need to be
transparent about the steps taken to generate it. Providing that level of detail can be time-consuming, but it’s also
an opportunity to strengthen the reproducibility and clarity of your work. Over time, these practices become more
intuitive and rewarding.

### What advice would you give to other researchers who want to make their science more open?

_Golnaz Taheri_: Start small but make a commitment to being transparent and open. Share your data and code early in the process and
follow the FAIR principles to ensure that your work is accessible and reusable. It’s also important to engage with
platforms that support Open Science, such as GitHub for code, and utilize institutional resources like NBIS and Bianca
for computational support. Finally, prioritize collaboration and ask for feedback from others; Open Science is not just
about sharing your work, but about creating a community that can help each other advance science more efficiently.

_Gisele Miranda_: Start by choosing one dataset or project code and make it FAIR. Often, the true impact of a resource
only becomes clear after it’s been shared. It also helps to align with existing
communities. Look at how others in your field format and document their outputs. Following
those standards not only makes your work more visible but also encourage reuse. Clear
documentation can make a big difference in whether your work gets adopted more broadly.

### How does SciLifeLab/DDLS Fellow program facilitate Open Science in your work?

_Golnaz Taheri_: The SciLifeLab/DDLS Fellow program has been crucial in supporting Open Science in my work by providing access
to invaluable resources like NBIS, Bianca, and Berzelius. These platforms allow me to manage, analyse, and share large
biological datasets efficiently, making my work more accessible to others. Furthermore, SciLifeLab’s Open Science
culture, supported by Sweden’s strong open access policies, provides a robust infrastructure for data sharing and
collaboration.
Sweden’s support for covering journal publication fees has been particularly beneficial, as it removes the financial
barriers that researchers in other countries may face when trying to access or publish their work. This open access
model ensures that scientific findings are freely available to everyone, promoting global knowledge sharing and
accelerates new collaborations.

_Gisele Miranda_: The SciLifeLab/DDLS Fellow program has been instrumental in supporting Open Science
through robust infrastructure and clear guidance for implementing FAIR principles. The
program also provides access to training opportunities and resources that make it easier to
publish data, code, and workflows. Moreover, it also promotes the development and
dissemination of open-source tools and encourages the use of public repositories.

### What was your favourite holiday you’ve been on?

_Golnaz Taheri_: I went to Malaysia and Singapore a few years ago, and I absolutely loved it. Both places are incredibly
unique, with Malaysia offering vibrant street food, thick and green rainforests, and cultural diversity, while
Singapore amazed me with its modern skyline, beautiful gardens, and impressive mix of tradition and innovation. The
contrast in food, nature, and culture made the trip unforgettable. I really enjoyed exploring the local markets, trying
new foods, and experiencing the different ways of life.

_Gisele Miranda_: I really enjoy traveling and exploring new places, whether it’s a different country or just
discovering a new part of Stockholm and having some fika! I find a lot of inspiration in
seeing how people live, eat, and create in different cultures.

#### Bonus: Community Practice and Networking

_Gisele Miranda_: I’m involved in several communities, both online and through conferences and training
programs. One forum in particular, image.sc, is very active in supporting Open Science and
tool development in the imaging community. It’s a great space for exchanging ideas and
getting support.
Having this kind of community support is incredibly valuable. When building or participating
in an Open Science network, it’s important that members feel they are gaining something
meaningful, whether that’s getting helpful answers, increasing the visibility of their work, or
finding new opportunities for collaboration.

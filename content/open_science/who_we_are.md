The Open Science Team is dedicated to advancing FAIR and Open Science at SciLifeLab and within the life sciences
community, embedding Open Science principles into every aspect of our work.

While we have a dedicated Open Science team, the principles of Open Science are embraced across our entire organisation,
making every team member within SciLifeLab a part of our broader Open Science efforts.

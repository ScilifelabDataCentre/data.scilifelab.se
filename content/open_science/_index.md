At SciLifeLab, the Open Science team is dedicated to equipping researchers with the tools and resources needed to leverage
Open Science practices effectively. We aim to foster a culture of openness and integrate Open Science principles into our
systems and research workflows.

We support researchers by providing guidance to help make their research outputs discoverable, accessible, and properly
credited through open access publishing and community-trusted repositories. By promoting transparency, we encourage fair
attribution, ethical sharing, and responsible research practices.

Our team stays informed on Open Science policies and guidelines at the national, international, and funder levels,
integrating these with SciLifeLabâ€™s policies. We also work to coordinate and support communities that promote collaboration
around [Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about?hub=686) and [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

Our goal is to provide practical, straightforward guidance on how to navigate these evolving requirements, integrating
them into onboarding, systems, and training. Ultimately, we aim to drive cultural change toward FAIR and Open Science,
advance scientific discovery through openness, transparency, and collaboration, and foster meaningful connections with
the broader public.

## Why is Open Science important to SciLifeLab?

Open Science aims to make scientific research more transparent, accessible, and collaborative. By engaging with Open
Science principles, SciLifeLab can further improve the quality and reliability of the scientific outputs we produce and
the services that we provide. By engaging with Open Science principles, we ensure that publicly funded research is
accessible to the wider community, amplifying our global impact, accelerating innovation and maximising scientific
progress and societal benefit.

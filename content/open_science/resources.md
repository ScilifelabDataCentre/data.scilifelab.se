Welcome to our Open Science Resources page.
Here, you’ll find a collection of resources designed to help you integrate
[Open Science and FAIR principles](/open_science/glossary) into your work.

## SciLifeLab Resources {.highlighted-header #scilifelab-resources}

#### SciLifeLab Open Science Onboarding

Here you can find our Open Science Onboarding which will guide you through the essential concepts to get you started on
your open science journey.

#### Open Science Checklists

The following checklists are available to provide practical guidance on steps you can take to incorporate open science
and FAIR into your research workflows:

- Open Access Checklist
- Open Data Guidelines ([RDM Guidelines](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/))
- Software Citation Checklist
- [FAIR-Aware Self Assessment Tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/)

#### CoARA Action Plan for SciLifeLab

On 23 February 2024, SciLifeLab announced that it had joined [CoARA](https://coara.eu/) (Coalition for Advancing Research
Assessment) as a signatory member. This reaffirmed SciLifeLab’s commitment to advancing research assessment and open
science practices.
You can review SciLifeLab’s CoARA Action Plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KAKOK6HoXsixQA5FaPegDIw1w3uI6OvlHgT2YR1m0pg/edit?tab=t.0).
Note, [DORA](https://sfdora.org) (San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment) laid
the foundation for research assessment reform by advocating for qualitative evaluation over journal-based metrics,
a principle that CoARA builds upon to drive systemic change through collective institutional commitment.

#### SciLifeLab Data Policy

The [SciLifeLab Data Policy](https://www.scilifelab.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Data-Policy.pdf) outlines SciLifeLab's
commitment to Open Science, research transparency, and the FAIR
principles, ensuring that data from publicly funded research is as open as possible, while adhering to legal and
ethical requirements. It sets expectations for SciLifeLab-affiliated programs, infrastructure, and researchers to promote
data sharing, reproducibility, and accessibility, while providing the necessary resources, support, and governance to
integrate these principles into the research we produce.

#### SciLifeLab Training Hub

The [SciLifeLab Training Hub](https://www.scilifelab.se/training/) offers a range of educational opportunities and
training infrastructure, to advance Open Science and FAIR learning, ensuring Sweden’s life science community has open
access to world-class knowledge and expertise. View [SciLifeLab Training Hub’s website](https://www.scilifelab.se/training/)
to learn more about training tools, upcoming courses and ways in which the Training Hub team can support you.

#### SciLifeLab RDM Guidelines

{{< image_float

In collaboration with [NBIS](https://nbis.se/), SciLifeLab Data Centre has developed the
[Research Data Management Guidelines](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/) as a knowledge
hub to support Swedish life science researchers in managing their data throughout the research lifecycle. This resource
offers guidance on key topics, including data management plans, metadata, versioning, Open Science & FAIR principles.

#### FAIR-Aware Self Assessment Tool

The [FAIR-Aware Self Assessment Tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/) helps researchers evaluate their knowledge of the
FAIR principles, offering guidance to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of their
data. In addition, the [F-UJI FAIR assessment tool](https://www.f-uji.net/) is an automated tool designed to evaluate
the FAIRness of research data objects.

#### The National Guidelines for Open Science

The [National Library of Sweden](https://www.kb.se/) (Kungliga Biblioteket) has published
[National Guidelines on Open Science](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kb:publ-738), providing material for
Swedish institutions and research funders in aligning policies, infrastructure, and coordination efforts with
international recommendations. You can read The National Guidelines for Open Science
[here](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kb:publ-738).

#### The EU Open Science Policy

The [EU Open Science Policy](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/our-digital-future/open-science_en)
promotes openness, collaboration, and transparency in research by removing barriers, fostering data sharing, and
enhancing scientific impact. This is achieved by advocating for practices like open access, reproducibility, and citizen
engagement, and supporting these efforts with initiatives and infrastructures such as the
[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://eosc.eu/eosc-about/) and [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/).
EOSC provides a federated infrastructure for sharing and accessing research data across Europe, while OpenAIRE supports open science by enabling open access to publications, linking research outputs, and facilitating compliance with EU open science policies.

#### The Swedish Research Council: Vision and Guiding Principles

The [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/) (Vetenskaprådet) produced a
[Vision and Guiding Principles for Open Access to Research Data](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data/vision-and-guiding-principles.html).
This outlines a national strategy to ensure publicly funded research data is made "as open as possible, as closed as
necessary", with the goal of fully implementing the transition to open access by 2026. The recommendations emphasise
coordinated efforts among researchers, institutions, and funders to integrate open data practices, develop incentives,
and enhance usability. This is achieved through standardised frameworks, infrastructure, and FAIR data management
planning, while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations. Further details on Sweden’s approach to open
science, including policies on open access to publications, research data, and broader open science initiatives, can be
found on the [Swedish Research Council’s Open Science webpage](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science.html).
This platform serves as a central resource for national guidelines, ongoing projects, and collaborative efforts that
support Sweden’s transition towards open and FAIR research practices.

#### UNESCO Open Science Toolkit

[UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en) developed the [Open Science Toolkit](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/toolkit?hub=686),
a collection of guides, policies, and factsheets designed to support the implementation of the
[UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about?hub=686). You can review the UNESCO
Open Science Toolkit [here](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/toolkit?hub=686).

#### SUHF Roadmap for Open Science with Action Proposals for Implementation

The [roadmap](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2025/02/REC-2021-1-Open-Science-Roadmap-REVISED-31-01-2025.pdf) includes
overarching recommendations that clarify the responsibilities of higher education institutions, as well as proposals for
measures and capabilities that need to be established at these institutions during the transition to a responsible,
secure, and open scientific system.

#### Plan S/Coalition S

[Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) is a European initiative (with Swedish participation) that mandates full and
immediate Open Access for publicly funded research. Essential for researchers navigating open publishing policies.

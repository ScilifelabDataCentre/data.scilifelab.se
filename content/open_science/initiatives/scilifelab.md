SciLifeLab is a founding member of [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) - a community effort to collect a curated set of
analysis pipelines and modules built using Nextflow, aimed at enhancing reproducibility and collaboration. Different
groups, especially [National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI)](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/), are supporting both the
community and the development of pipelines. SciLifeLab Data Centre contributes to the development of the infrastructure
behind the initiative.

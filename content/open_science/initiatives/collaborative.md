## COARA {#coara}

The Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) is a global collective of over 700 member organisations,
including research institutions, funders, assessment authorities, and professional societies, united to reform how
research, researchers, and research organisations are evaluated.
Guided by a common set of principles and commitments, CoARA fosters collaboration, knowledge exchange, and mutual
learning to promote more inclusive and effective research evaluation practices.
Traditional assessment methods rely heavily on publication-based metrics, such as citation counts and journal impact
factor, which can overlook the diverse contributions of researchers. CoARA seeks to address this by promoting principles
and guidelines outlined in the [Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf),
published in July 2022, which offers a foundation for the reformation of current research assessment practices, to
recognise all aspects of research contributions.

### CoARA Action Plan for SciLifeLab: A Path Towards Recognising Diverse Contributions to Research Through Open Science and the FAIR Principles

On 23 February 2024, SciLifeLab announced its collaboration with CoARA, reaffirming our commitment to advancing research
assessment and open science practices within our work. In partnership with the [CoARA Swedish National Chapter](https://coara.eu/working-groups/national-chapters/coara-national-chapter-sweden/),
SciLifeLab established a new CoARA-SciLifeLab [Working Group](https://coara.eu/working-groups/working-groups/) to
develop actionable steps which align with CoARA’s objectives.

By joining CoARA, SciLifeLab aims to drive scientific breakthroughs through open science initiatives, such as enhanced
data and software sharing, while recognising diverse contributions across the research lifecycle.
We are actively working to implement CoARA’s principles at both national and international levels. By implementing this
collaborative approach, we hope to move beyond traditional, publication-based metrics and promote more inclusive
evaluation practices that recognise the full range of research contributions.

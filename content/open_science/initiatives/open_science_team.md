## Community of Practice {#community-of-practice}

An initiative to foster collaboration, innovation, and researcher-driven guidance in advancing Open Science and FAIR
principles in SciLifeLab services and projects.
We are building a dynamic community of 20+ members from diverse backgrounds — researchers, early-career professionals,
international experts, and infrastructure developers — united by the goal of shaping SciLifeLab’s services,
projects, and platforms to maximise impact for the scientific community.

Key aspects of the initiative include gathering insights early in development, driving continuous improvement through
actionable feedback, fostering a collaborative and inclusive expert community. It also emphasises engaging the wider
audience through outreach and networking, and recognising contributions to create impactful services and projects.

## FAIR Metadata Network {#fair-metadata-network}

An initiative aimed at promoting metadata and semantic technologies, along with the FAIR principles (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), to enhance data interoperability and support life sciences research.

The initiative seeks to understand how standards are being adopted, and the barriers preventing adoption, across
research domains, institutions, and funding agencies. This will be achieved by building expertise and fostering
collaborations among SciLifeLab [researchers](https://www.scilifelab.se/research/), [fellows](https://www.scilifelab.se/contact/fellows/),
and [infrastructure](https://www.scilifelab.se/services/infrastructure/) experts.

It addresses shared challenges in metadata management, including standards, curation, and discovery, while promoting
the use of semantic tools such as shared vocabularies, ontologies, and persistent identifiers. Additionally, the
initiative provides personalised support, workshops, seminars, and an online presence to engage stakeholders.

Through discussions, roundtables, and a dedicated Slack community, the initiative will continuously refine its approach
and expand its reach, strengthening data integration, discovery, and reuse. By doing so, it advances innovation in life
science research by facilitating more effective and connected research data.

## Open Science Monitoring Initiative {#open-science-monitoring-initiative}

At SciLifeLab, we monitor the compliance with Open Science and FAIR principles, as displayed in the
[annual report](https://www.scilifelab.se/about-us/management/all-reports/#h-annual-reports), which reviews the research
produced by our infrastructure units and affiliated researchers. As this process is highly resource intensive, we are 
procuring a software service to support large-scale, automated, and in-depth analysis of the publications and research
outputs produced by SciLifeLab.

The Open Science Monitoring Initiative aims to implement an automated solution for tracking Open Science indicators. 
Our initial focus is on analysing the data and software shared in SciLifeLab publications. By mining this information, 
we will assess how closely our community aligns with Open Science practices, policies, and guidelines. Using this 
information, we will develop an interactive dashboard to help the community explore, interpret, and engage with the
findings.

This initiative aims to deepen our understanding of Open Science practices within SciLifeLab, enhance transparency, and
inform improvements in our policies, guidelines, and practices, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of Open Science
innovation.

## AI Network {#ai-network}

SciLifeLab is launching an AI Network to foster a collaborative community for researchers, infrastructure users, and
staff working with AI in life science. The initiative will build on the existing monthly
[AI Seminar Series](https://www.scilifelab.se/research/scilifelab-seminar-series/ai-seminar-series/), led jointly by 
NBIS and DC, which "aims to facilitate knowledge sharing pertaining to artificial intelligence (AI) among the life 
science community". This network will support this existing seminar series by providing an AI focused discussion
platform where members can:

* Connect with others to seek advice, discuss challenges, and receive feedback
* Reduce duplicated efforts and identify opportunities for collaboration
* Share insights and experiences in leveraging AI for discovery and efficiency
* Discuss and explore AI applications in life science research
* Support the development of shared resources, tools, and workflows for AI-driven research

The AI Network is a project aimed at unifying all AI related communities, work groups and activities within 
SciLifeLab - opening them to the broader public and enabling cross-community discovery to increase their impact.

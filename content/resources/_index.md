On this page, we list our 'resources'. Resources are sets of information focused on a given topic relevant to data-driven life science in Sweden. Each resource includes valuable information that we have compiled in order to aid you with your research. The topic of a resource could be, for example, the compute resources available for data-driven life science research in Sweden. Resources differ from [services](https://data.scilifelab.se/services/) in that resources are just for information, whilst services are something that can be used directly in research (e.g. a tool or database).

To find relevant resources, simply use the search function located at the top of this section.

We will continue to expand this section over time. If you have a suggestion for a resource, or if you require further support in the areas considered in this section, please [get in touch](/contact/).

---

Here is a list of potential data sources that can be used for data-driven life sciences in Sweden.

Use the search and filter options on the left to find appropriate sources. The entries are split into two types: **repository** and **data source**. A type of 'repository' indicates that at least some users can both submit and access data. A type of 'data source' indicates that data can only be accessed; data cannot be submitted.

If you are aware of data sources that are not listed here, please [get in touch](/contact/).

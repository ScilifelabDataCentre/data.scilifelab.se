## About the hosting environment

The technical environment of the SciLifeLab Data Platform hosts web-based computational tools and databases related to data-driven life science research. This will include compute-intensive software and large-volume datasets.

The hosting environment is hosted on a three-node Kubernetes cluster (hardware located at KTH IT) with connected on-prem (from KTH IT) and cloud (SUNET) storage, which is managed by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data). User-oriented services offered on the SciLifeLab Data Platform are available to any researcher in Sweden, regardless of whether they are affiliated with SciLifeLab. Services targetted towards data-producing facilities are available to SciLifeLab infrastructure units, but we welcome enquiries from others.

The platform will initially integrate services developed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and their partners. A number of external pathfinder projects will be also identified for the purpose of technology development, and presented on the platform. We intend to formalise a process by which others may apply for services to be hosted on the SciLifeLab Data Platform, so that they can be made available both nationally and internationally. Individual research groups, organisations, and communities developing such tools will be welcomed to apply.

The hosting and usage of services on the SciLifeLab Data Platform will be made available to all life science researchers in Sweden free of charge. All costs are covered by the [SciLifeLab & Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven).

## Vision & mission

This platform aims to boost the number of services available for data-driven life science research in Sweden. Special attention will be paid to **enabling compute-intensive and large data volume services**, which are unlikely to be made available elsewhere.

Our vision for the SciLifeLab Data Platform is to create an environment in which users (researchers, bioinformaticians, software engineers, healthcare professionals, industry partners, etc.), can easily locate, access, and use life science data (from research projects, from data-producing infrastructures, from data sharing platforms, etc.), and e-Infrastructure (specifically, national computing and storage infrastructures for research).

We will strive to forge strong connections with Swedish e-infrastructure, and with providers of international toolsets and databases, such as those maintained by the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Our efforts will be guided by consultations and collaborations with the research community and the efforts of Swedish universities. We will work both within fields of research that represent our priority areas and life sciences in general.

**Open science** and **open source** values are at the core of the SciLifeLab Data Platform. The development and integration of each tool hosted on the platform will be driven by by community input. Any data hosted is expected to meet a minimum level of **FAIR**ness, and to be as open as possible but as closed as necessary, in line with privacy, legal, and ethical concerns. External tools and databases adhering to these principles are welcome to get in touch with the SciLifeLab Data Centre to discuss the possibility of hosting and/or collaboration. We especially welcome local initiatives that want to broaden their userbase to the national level, as well as community-driven projects.

## Application to host a service

In the near future, we will enable others to apply for web-based tools and databases to be hosted on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. Research groups, research communities, and organisations based in Sweden will all be welcome to apply. Please note that the resources made available on the hosting cluster cannot be used for completing processing or providing storage for a given project. Instead, each tool/database hosted should have value to the wider research community. Please email [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) to discuss potential collaborations, and/or the possibility of us hosting a tool/database.

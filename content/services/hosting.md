## About the hosting environment

The SciLifeLab Data Platform technical environment is dedicated to hosting web-based computational tools and databases for data-driven life science research, including compute-intensive software and large-volume datasets. The services are hosted on a three-node Kubernetes cluster (hardware located at KTH IT) with connected on-prem (KTH IT) and cloud (SUNET) storage, managed by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data). User-oriented services offered as part of the SciLifeLab Data Platform are available to any researcher in Sweden, regardless of the SciLifeLab affiliation. Services oriented at data-producing facilities are available to SciLifeLab facilities and enquiries are welcome from others.

In the early phases, the platform will build on existing strengths and integrate services already in development by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. In parallel, a number of external pathfinder projects will be identified for the purpose of technology development. In the near future, the goal is to formulate a specific set of requirements and an application procedure for services to be hosted on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. Individual research groups, organisations, and communities developing such tools will then be invited to make use of this technical environment to host services and make them available at the national or international level.

Hosting and usage of services on the SciLifeLab Data Platform which are then made available to all life science researchers in Sweden is free of charge, funded by the [SciLifeLab & Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven).

## Vision & mission

The ambition of the platform is to provide a strong IT environment allowing to significantly boost available services for data-driven life science research in Sweden. Special attention will be paid to **enabling compute-intensive and large data volume services** which would otherwise not be offered. We see the SciLifeLab Data Platform as the environment in which users (researchers, bioinformaticians, software engineers, healthcare professionals, industry partners, etc.), life science data (from research projects, from data-producing infrastructures, from data sharing platforms, etc.), and e-Infrastructure (specifically, national computing and storage infrastructures for research) meet and interface with each other.

Where possible, the ambition is to create strong connections with national e-infrastructure in Sweden and international toolsets and databases such as those mainted by the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). These efforts will be driven in collaboration and consultation with the research community and local university efforts, both within specific fields of research that are our priority areas and life scientists in general.

**Open science** and **open source** values are at the core of the SciLifeLab Data Platform. The development and integration of each tool hosted on the platform should be guided by community input, data hosted on the platform is expected to meet a minimum level of **FAIR**ness, be as open as possible as closed as necessary, based on privacy, legal, and ethical concerns. External tools and databases adhering to these principles are welcome to get in touch with the Data Centre to discuss hosting and/or collaboration possibilities. We especially welcome local initiatives that would like to broaden their userbase to the national level and community-driven projects.

## Application to host a service

In the near future we plan to allow applications for hosting web-based tools and databases on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. Research groups, research communities, and organizations in Sweden will be welcome to apply. The goal of the SciLifeLab Data Platform is to enable as many users as possible to access computational tools and databases for data-driven life science research. Please note that the resources of the cluster cannot be used for data processing and storage for the purpose of work on a particular research project, each service should present value to a wider research community. If you have any questions or would like to discuss collaboration or hosting your tool or data on the platform, send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se.

The SciLifeLab Data Platform includes an environment for hosting web-based tools and databases related to data-driven life science that require large-scale compute and storage resources. The hosting environment is [maintained by the SciLifeLab Data Centre](/about/). We have made available information regarding the [technical set-up of the environment and our vision for it](./hosting/). Researchers, research communities, and organisations in Sweden are welcome to [apply for a tool/database to be hosted on the platform](./hosting/#application). All services hosted on the platform follow open science principles and have an open source codebase.

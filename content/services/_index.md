The SciLifeLab Data Platform includes a technical environment for hosting tools and databases that can be deployed or accessed via the web. The hosting resources are [managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre](/about/). Individual researchers, research groups, and research organisations are enouraged to [learn more and apply for hosting](./hosting/).

Below, you will find information about [resources related to hosting](#for-researchers) and [for data-producing facilities](#for-facilities) that are either hosted or linked via the SciLifeLab Data Platform.

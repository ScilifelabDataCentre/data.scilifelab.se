Our latest [data highlight](/highlights/), entitled: [Large effort study to elucidate replication initiation in bacteria](/highlights/bacterial_replication/), is based on [Knöppel _et al._ (2023)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2213795120).

Over the last 50 years, the research community has studied the coordination of DNA copying and cell division in bacteria. The studies completed have shown that a protein called DnaA is key in the replication of _Escherichia coli_. Recent studies have made use of microscropy in order to advance our understanding of _E. coli_ replication processes, but much is still unknown. Knöppel _et al._ used high-throughput fluorescence microscopy to study the coordination of replction and division cycles in _E. coli_. Their results supported the initiator activation/deactivation cycling model for _E. coli_ replication initiation, but the researchers advocate for further studies into this model.

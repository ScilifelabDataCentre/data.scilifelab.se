SciLifeLab's [Capability for Precision Medicine](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/precision-medicine/) and [Training Hub](https://training.scilifelab.se/) are working together to strengthen the competence within precision medicine in Sweden, in order to advance research in this area.

**YOUR INPUT** is requested to be able to achieve this! They have created a **brief survey** about the needs for training/education in the precision medicine research community. The survey will take approximately **5 minutes to complete**. The results will be used to prioritise what type of training material or courses that could be made accessible for the community through SciLifeLab.

[Click here to access the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNLsnYnUuVoMBWfEM_ZkiLgTPLKRwk4P2BFVWxbziDWDKabw/viewform). **The survey will close on 15th September**.

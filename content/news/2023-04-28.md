We have added two new [services](/services/) pages that are designed to aid researchers, research groups, and research infrastructure to make use of compute resources (otherwise known as e-infrastructure).

The first new service is related to [hosting](/services/hosting/) on the SciLifeLab Data Platform's technical environment. Scilifelab provides e-infrastructure services complementing those available from national e-infrastructures, and with a focus on resources for FAIR data sharing. This includes compute- and storage resources for hosted services adhering to principles of FAIR and Open Science. For more information, and to learn how to apply, please see the [page on 'hosting on the SciLifeLab Data Platform](/services/hosting/).

The second new service is a compilation of information related to [compute resources available in Sweden](/services/e-infrastructure/). This is designed to improve awareness of the e-infrastructure available in Sweden. On that page, we have also include information on how to apply for access.

We will continue to expand on these services in future. We welcome and suggestions for additions or potential clarifications. Please feel free to [get in touch with us](/contact/).

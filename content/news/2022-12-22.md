date: 2022-12-22

We on the SciLifeLab Data Platform would like to take this opportunity to to wish you all 'God jul och gott nytt Ã¥r!'. We'd also like to thank the data-driven life science community in Sweden for their support in our very first year! We've developed some great collaborations with the community this year, and look forward to continuing those (and building even more!) next year.

The team are also getting into the spirit, and support levels will be lower during the holiday period. We'll be back to normal levels of support from 9th January 2023.

In the meantime, please feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) with us, and we'll get back to you as quickly as you can! We're always really happy to hear about any [jobs, funding, or project opportunities](/jobs/), potential [data highlights](/highlights/), or [events](/events/) that could be of interest to the data-driven life science community.

title: Request for descriptions of proposed national data services related to Epidemiology and Biology of Infection
date: 2024-08-29

SciLifeLab collaborates with specific partner organisations to organise work related to data services and bioinformatics support as part of [The SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/). This work takes place at one of four Data Science Nodes. These four nodes, one for each of the scientific focus areas of the DDLS program, are located across Sweden. They comprise of staff from [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) and [NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden)](https://nbis.se/). The staff are embedded in relevant environments at the hosting organisations, and are also integrated in the Data Platform and bioinformatics support teams, respectively.

The Epidemiology and Biology of Infection Node (hosted at Ume√• University) is reaching out to the data-driven life science community to better understand their needs. In particular, they are seeking descriptions of potential national data services in the field of epidemiology and biology of infection. The proposals will be assessed by the node for inclusion in the SciLifeLab Data Platform. Services included in the Data Platform will benefit from, among other things, significantly increased promotion, which could lead to greater opportunities for funding opportunities and collaboration.

To find out more about the process and requirements for proposing services, please see the [Epidemiology and Biology of Infection National Data Services request document](/service_requests/DDLS-EBI-request-for-descriptions-of-services_2024.pdf). **The deadline for submission is 30th September at 23:59 CET**.

title: Addition of multiple services and databases relevant for data-driven life science

Multiple services have recently been added to our [services list](/services/). This includes multiple open source services, such as [Scout](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout) (a visualiser for variant call format (VCF) files), and [Tomte](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/tomte) (a pipeline to analyse RNA-Seq data from rare disease patients) from [Clinical Genomics Stockholm](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/clinical-genomics-stockholm/). Multiple services from the [Sonnhammer Bioinformatics Group](https://sonnhammer.org) were also added, including [InParanoiDB](https://inparanoidb.sbc.su.se/) (a protein ortholog database for over 640 species), and [PathBIX](https://pathbix.sbc.su.se/) (a web server for novel network-based pathway enrichment analysis).

For all services in our list, we provide a **short summary on what the service does**, as well as **information on who manages the service, where to get support**, and **what 'type' of service it is** (e.g. tool, workflow). Our **search function** can be used to identify the services most relevant to you. All of these services are available for use by researchers and/or data producing facilities in Sweden, and involve SciLifeLab.

More databases have also been added to our [data sources and repositories list](/resources/data_sources/). This list is continuously updated with **data sources** (places where users can download data) and **repositories** (places where users can potentially share data), in order to make data more findable, and to aid users in sharing data more openly.

If you have a tool, database, workflow, or other research resource that you would like promoted on the SciLifeLab Data Platform, [get in touch](/contact/)!

Multiple new services have recently been added to our [services list](/services/). This includes multiple open source services, such as [Scout](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout) and [Tomte](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/tomte) from [Clinincal Genomics Stockholm](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/clinical-genomics-stockholm/).

For all services in our list, we provide a **short summary on what the service does**, as well as **information on who manages the service, where to get support, and what 'type' of service it is**. Our **search function** can be used to identify services most relevant to you.

All services in the list are available for use by researchers/data producing facilities in Sweden, and involve SciLifeLab. If you have a service that you would like for us to promote on the SciLifeLab Data Platform, [get in touch](/contact/)!

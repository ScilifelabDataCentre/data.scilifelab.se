It is now easier than ever to get your work featured on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. All you have to do is [get in touch](/contact/) to tell us about what you'd like to share/have hosted, so that we can begin the review process.

We offer hosting for services related to data-driven life science in Sweden, and are happy to include services hosted elsewhere in our [Service catalogue](/services/). We also publish short, data-focused articles (data highlights) to promote research that shares data and/or code in accordance with the principles of FAIR and open data sharing.

We update jobs, calls, and events/training opportunities on the site weekly, and are happy to hear about opportunities that you'd like promoted within the Swedish data-driven life science community.

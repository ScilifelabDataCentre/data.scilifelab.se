We have published a new data highlight, entitled: [METTL3 localisation during SARS-CoV-2 infection could highlight new novel antiviral strategy](/highlights/mettl3_localisation/), which is based on [Vaid and Mendez _et al._ (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.276407.121).

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of finding novel routes for treatment in minimising the negative effect of infectious diseases on society.
The N6-Methyladenosine modification (m6A) is one of the most common cellular RNA modifications, and known to play a crucial role in the regulation of RNA metabolism during the stress response. Vaid and Mendez _et al_ investigated changes in m6A expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection to determine whether this could be the key to novel or improved antiviral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. They found that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a loss of m6A in cellular RNAs. This was related to partial relocalisation of the methyltransferase METTL3/METTL14 complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Both sequencing data and analysis code from this study are shared.

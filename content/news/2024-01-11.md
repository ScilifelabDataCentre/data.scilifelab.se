We have recently added multiple open source tools to our [services list](/services/). We define services as tools, databases, and support services (e.g. hosting and compute services) that can be used in data-driven life science research. Whilst we list services associated with SciLifeLab, the services can be used anywhere in the world, free of charge, unless otherwise stated.

The newly listed services are primarily tools for use with sequence data. For example, [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/) detects and removes unwanted sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads, and [CheckQC](http://checkqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) checks a set of quality control criteria against an Illumina reader. Other newly listed services include [Chanjo](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/chanjo) (a sequencing coverage assessment tool), [nf-core/Sarek](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek) (a workflow designed to detect variants), [GENMOD](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/genmod) (a tool to annotate and analyse genomic variants), and [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info) (a tool that aggregates the results of bioinformatics analyses across many samples). We have also added [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) to our services list. [Nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is a community effort to collect a set of analysis pipelines and modules built using Nextflow. Whilst some of the pipelines and modules listed on nf-core are designed for work with sequence data (e.g. [nf-core/Sarek](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek)), many are instead intended for use with other types of data.

We will continue to list new [services](/services/) over time. If you are aware of a revelant service that is not listed, please [get in touch with us](/contact/). We will review any suggestions as soon as possible, and promptly list relevant services.

If you are instead interested in learning more about a particular area, then please check out our [resources](/resources/) section. Our resources are collections of information on a given topic. Fir example, we have resources related to the compute and storage resources available for use with data-driven life science in Sweden.

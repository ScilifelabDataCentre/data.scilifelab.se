A new data highlight has been added to the SciLifeLab Data Platform. This latest data highlight, entitled ['A deep learning framework to estimate species diversity'](https://data.scilifelab.se/highlights/deep_learning_framework_estimate_biodiversity/) considers a recent publication by [Andermann *et al.* (2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.839407/full). The study explores whether deep learning frameworks can be used to accurately estimate biodiversity, and thus to target conservation efforts.

We're starting off the post-summer season on the SciLifeLab Data Platform with a new [data highlight](/highlights/). This [latest highlight](/highlights/daphnia_dna_methylation/), summarises a recent paper by [Feiner *et al.* (2022)](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)00573-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004222005739%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). The study explored whether epigenetic effects, induced by stressors, could influence freshwater ecosystems long-term. The study focussed in particular on the impact that climate change could have on this threatened ecosystem type.

Have you completed some data-driven life science research and openly shared the shared data and/or code? Why not get in touch about having it featured as a data highlight?

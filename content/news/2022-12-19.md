We have published a new [data highlight](/highlights/), entitled ['Cryo-electron tomography allows new knowledge about poliovirus replication and assembly sites in situ'](/highlights/poliovirus_replication/), which is based on [Dahmane *et al.* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33483-7). The study used cryo-electron tomography to examine how enteroviruses are assembled and packaged into autophagosomes. Enteroviruses cause many diseases, some of which can have devastating effects on society, such as polio. The data and code related to the study are openly shared to support the reproduction of the results of the present study, as well as future studies in this area. This highlight is also published on the [COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/), as it relates to pandemic preparedness work.

Do you have some data-driven life science research that you'd like to highlight on the SciLifeLab Data Platform? Or perhaps you have events/jobs/projects in your group that you'd like to advertise on the SciLifeLab data platform? If so, please fill out the forms on the appropriate pages (e.g. [in the data highlights section](/highlights/)), or email us at datacentre@scilifelab.se.

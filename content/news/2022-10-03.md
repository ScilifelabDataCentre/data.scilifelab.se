title: New service related to the subcellular localisation of proteins and the outcomes of the SubCellBarCode project.

Today, we have launched a new [service page](/services/) related to the SubCellBarCode project. The [SubCellBarCode service page](/subcellbarcode/) is a collation of all of the resources (including tools, web portal, publications, methodologies, etc.) produced as part of the SubCellBarCode project. This page has been produced in close collaboration with those involved in the project and will be updated with new outcomes over time.

The aim of this service page is to facilitate the use of the tools and resources generated within the SubCellBarCode project. The project has shared a significant amount of data, in-depth explanations regarding the methodologies used, and multiple research tools (e.g. R analysis package, visualisation tools). Each of these elements can be accessed from the [SubCellBarCode service page](/subcellbarcode/). It is hoped that the collation and promotion of these resources will accelerate efforts related to the subcellular localisation of proteins. Such studies are incredibly important, particularly as they have implications in human disease e.g. in cancer.

If you have a tool/dataset/service/set of resources that you think that we should add to our [service catalogue](/services/), reach out to [let us know!](/contact/)

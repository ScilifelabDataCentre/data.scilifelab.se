We have published a new data highlight, entitled ['New study shows that perserverance can be the reason for antibiotic resistance development'](/highlights/antibiotic_resistance_development/), which is based on [Brandis *et al.* (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2216216120)

Antibiotic resistance is often termed the 'silent pandemic'. As resistance to antibiotics becomes more widespread, it is becoming clearer that there may be a day where currently curable diseases are no longer easily treatable with antiobiotics. In a recent publication, researchers systematically exposed *Escherichia coli* to above-MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) or sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics in order to study the development of resistance.As a result of this work, the researchers described a new concept; antibiotic perseverance. They defined antibiotic perseverance as the ability of a subpopulation to maintain replication longer than the main population even at the MIC. Antibiotic perseverance was found to be a common phenomenon that increased the risk of the development of resistance by up to 40-fold in both gram-negative and gram-positive species. Raw microscopy image data and code used for analysis are both openly shared.

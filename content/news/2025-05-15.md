The Open Science Team hosted a webinar in collaboration with DeSci Publish, where we explored how researchers can curate, link, and share
their data, software, protocols, and other related outputs independently of traditional publishing workflows.

During the session, the DeSci Publish team demonstrated how their platform allows researchers to link and disseminate their outputs via the
decentralised web, using digital object identifiers (DOIs) to make those outputs globally discoverable and citable. You can read more about
the DeSci Publish team on the [DeSci website](https://www.desci.com/publish).

Presenters included:
- Philipp Koellinger, President of the DeSci Foundation
- Christopher Erdmann, Head of Open Science, SciLifeLab

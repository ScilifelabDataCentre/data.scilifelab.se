Today, we have published a new [data highlight](/highlights/) on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. This [latest highlight](/highlights/generode/), details work on the GenErode pipeline as described in a recent paper by [Kutschera *et al.* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-022-04757-0). The GenErode pipeline is the first bioinformatics pipeline that can process and analyse ancient, historical, and modern sequencing data from the same species with the aim of generating comparable estimates of genomic erosion indices. Experience with coding with not necessary to work with this pipeline, and all bioinformatics steps are well documented, making it very accessible to users.

Have you completed some data-driven life science research and openly shared the data and/or code? Why not get in touch about having it featured as a data highlight? You can contact us by completing the form in our [data highlights section](/highlights/), or emailing us at datacentre@scilifelab.se.

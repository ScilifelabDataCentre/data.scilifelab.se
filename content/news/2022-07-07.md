Check out the latest [data highlight](/highlights/) added to the SciLifeLab Data Platform. This highlight, entitled ['Unravelling the assembly of the mitoribosome'](/highlights/unravelling_mitoribosome_assembly/), relates to a recent publication by [Itoh *et al.* (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04795-x). The study uses cryo-electron microscopy to understand the mechanisms underlying mitoribosomal assembly. 

It is the first data highlight to be drafted by one of the corresponding authors of the original paper - in this case, senior author Prof. Alexey Amunts. If you're interested in writing a data highlight to promote data-driven life science research that you've been involved in, please complete the form in our [data highlights section](/highlights/), or email us at datacentre@scilifelab.se.

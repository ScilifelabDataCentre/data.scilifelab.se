Please join us for the [official launch of the Platform - May 26th at 11am via Zoom](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/scilifelab-data-platform-launch/)! 

At this launch event, we will demonstrate how the data platform supports data-diven life science, the services we offer, and how you can get access to hosting resources. In addition, a number of our users will present their user cases, followed by a summary.

To find out more about this and other events related to data-driven life science in Sweden, see our [events](/events/) page!

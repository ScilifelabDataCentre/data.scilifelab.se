We have published a new data highlight, entitled: [Variability in IGH antibody genes influences the response to SARS-CoV-2](/highlights/igh_antibody_genes/), which is based on [Pushparaj et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2022.12.005).

The pandemic has highlighted the importance of research into our ability to control infections and interindividual response to disease and vaccination. While some genes have been found to be connected with protective effects against SARS-CoV-2, others have been connected with increased risk to develop severe disease. The immunoglobulin heavy-chain IGHV1-69 gene is highly polymorphic and as such likely to have implications for the human response to infection, and vaccination. In their study Pradeepa Pushparaj and colleagues from Karolinska Institutet (_Corresponding author:_ Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam) studied the role of IGH germline gene variation in antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. The researchers showed that human IGH antibody genes are highly variable and germline-encoded residues specific to given IGHV1-69 alleles can shape the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This means that genetic differences can influence our antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and shape long-lived memory B cell responses induced by infection or vaccination. Both data and the IgDiscover software are openly shared.

The Open Science Team hosted a webinar which explored the role of community in advancing open science and research impact.

In the session, we explored real-world examples of successful Communities of Practice and the unique value they bring to both researchers
and institutions. We also shared how these stories inspired us at SciLifeLab to begin planning our own Community of Practice, with the goal
of fostering a more collaborative, open, and supportive research culture.

Speakers included:
- Bogdana Huma: Associate Professor of Language and Communication, Vrije University Amsterdam
- Josh Gottesman: Community Director, Michael J. Fox Foundation
- Mirjam Walpot: SciLifeLab Data Centre; Board Member – International Network of Open Science & Scholarship Communities (INOSC)
- Suné Joubert: Project Coordinator (Open Science Communities and Metrics), SciLifeLab

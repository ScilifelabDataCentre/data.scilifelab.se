title: Information about accessing storage resources added
date: 2023-09-07

We have now added a second resource to our new [resources section](/resources/). This resource details the [storage resources](/resources/storage/) available in Sweden and how to access them. These resources can be used to store data and potentially other types of resources. This latest page is considered a compliment to our [compute resources page](/resources/e-infrastructure/), which provides information about resources related to analysis and hosting.

If you are interested in finding out more about compute and storage resources, please join our [Overview of compute and storage resources in data-driven life science event](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/overview-of-compute-and-storage-resources-in-data-driven-life-science/) tomorrow (8th September 2023). A recording will be made available after the event.

If you have questions related to compute and storage resources in Sweden, or comments about our resources pages, please [contact us](/contact/).

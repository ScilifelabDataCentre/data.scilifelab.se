Our latest [data highlight](/highlights/) is now live on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. This [latest highlight](/highlights/bayesian_open_habitat/), summarises a recent paper by [Andermann *et al.* (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32300-5). The study explores the evolution and expansion of open grassland habitats. The study uses deep learning models that are trained using information on mammal-plant interactions based on openly available fossil record data.

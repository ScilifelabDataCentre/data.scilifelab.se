We are pleased to announce the launch of [SciLifeLab RDM (research data management) guidelines](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se). This new resource, developed and maintained in collaboration with [NBIS](https://nbis.se), will act as a knowledge hub for the management of life science research data in Sweden. The resource will be updated and expanded over time, with new features and sections already planned. As always, we encourage you to [get in touch](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/contact/) with any feedback that you might have on this new service.

If you have a tool/dataset/service/set of resources that you think should be added to our [service catalogue](/services/), please [let us know!](/contact/).

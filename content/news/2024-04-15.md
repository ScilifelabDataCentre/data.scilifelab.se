A new resource entitled ['Data Sources'](/resources//data_sources/) has been added to the SciLifeLab Data Platform. The resource lists sources of data that can be used by data-driven life science researchers in Sweden. We are looking for feedback from the community about how this resource might be improved in future, and encourage users to [get in touch with us about any suggestions](/contact/).

The list includes entries where data can be both deposited and downloaded (termed **'repositories'**), and those where data can just be accessed (termed **'data sources'**). Users can search for particular entries by their name or keywords (allowing for more granularity), and can also filter the list according to a particular **type of data** (e.g. protein data, phylogenetic data) and/or **scientific area**. The list currently contains over 80 entries, and will be expanded over time.

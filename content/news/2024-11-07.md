The latest [data highlight](/highlights/) is entitled ['New tool allows users to navigate both full-length protein and domain orthologs'](/highlights/inparanoidb/), and is based on recent research by [Persson, E., & Sonnhammer, E. L. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283623000578?via%3Dihub).

Version 9 of InParanoiDB includes data from both [InParanoid-DIAMOND](https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergroup/inparanoid/src/master/) and [Domainoid](https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergroup/domainoid/src/master/). It represents an extensive online resource, featuring over 346 million protein ortholog groups and nearly 758 million orthologous domain groups across 640 species pairs. This marks a significant increase in coverage compared to the previous version, which included 273 species and 8 million ortholog groups. The database contains approximately 743 million full-length protein ortholog pairs and over 1.6 billion domain pairs, with more than 6.6 million proteins having at least one ortholog. The ratio of proteins to domains with orthologs is 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Overall, InParanoiDB 9 offers enhanced coverage and detail, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of orthology.

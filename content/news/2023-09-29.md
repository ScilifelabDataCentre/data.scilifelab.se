We have now launched our third [resource](/resources/), which is focused on how to use alternative metrics. In particular, the resource describes what altmetrics are, why they're important for researchers, how to use them, and how to maximise your score. The resources have now been made accessible directly on the front page of the platform. As you'll see, the other resources detail the [compute](/resources/e-infrastructure/) and [storage](/resources/storage/) resources in Sweden, and how to access them.

If you are interested in finding out more about any of the topics listed in resources, or have ideas for additional resources, please [contact us](/contact/) with your suggestion.

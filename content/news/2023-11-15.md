[SciLifeLab FAIR Storage](/services/fairstorage) has now been added as our latest [service](/services/). SciLifeLab FAIR Storage is a service providing storage resources to enable FAIR data sharing within Swedish data-driven life science. The applications and allocation of resources will be managed by SciLifeLab Data Centre.

Documents related to the use and application of the resource can be found at the [SciLifeLab FAIR Storage service page](/services/fairstorage). More guidelines and information will be added to the page as it becomes available.

There will be an [event aimed at explaining how to apply to use FAIR Storage resources on November 30th 10:00 â€“ 11:30 (CET)](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/fairstorage/). There will also be a call open through the Swedish User and Project Repository (SUPR) Portal (call open Nov 16th - Dec 31st). If you'd like to reach out with any questions directly, you can do so using the contact information for the service shown on our [services page](/services/). In this case, you can send an email to [FAIRstorage@scilifelab.se](mailto:FAIRstorage@scilifelab.se).

[SciLifeLab FAIR Storage](/services/fairstorage) has now been added as our latest [service](/services/). SciLifeLab FAIR Storage is a service providing storage resources to enable FAIR data sharing within Swedish data-driven life science. The applications and allocation of resources will be managed by SciLifeLab Data Centre.

Documents related to the use and application of the resource can be found at the [SciLifeLab FAIR Storage service page](/services/fairstorage). More guidelines and information will be added to the page as it becomes available.

If you have any questions, you can contact the service directly using the details shown on our [services page](/services/). In this case, you can send an email to [FAIRstorage@scilifelab.se](mailto:FAIRstorage@scilifelab.se).

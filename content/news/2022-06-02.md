Today marks the official launch of the SciLifeLab Data Platform website, which can be found at [data.scilifelab.se](https://data.scilifelab.se). The Platform will act as a hub for data-driven life science in Sweden. It will include work on data-driven life science from all those affiliated with a Swedish research institution, not just SciLifeLab. The Platform will incorporate multiple resources (tools, services, and datasets), and highlight relevant news, data, and events. Much more will be added over time, so watch this space.

***We invite the the research community to contribute to all sections of the Platform. We welcome their feedback on the current content, as well as their suggestions on what else they would like to see here.***

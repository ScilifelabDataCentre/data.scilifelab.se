The SciLifeLab Data Platform technical environment is dedicated to hosting unique computational tools and databases for data-driven life science research, including compute-intensive software and large-volume datasets. The services are hosted on a three-node Kubernetes cluster managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre. Services offered as part of the SciLifeLab Data Platform are available to any researcher or research facility in Sweden, regardless of the SciLifeLab affiliation. Community-driven or local university efforts are invited to make use of this technical environment to make services available at the national level. Both using and hosting services is at the moment free of charge, funded by SciLifeLab and the Wallenberg National Program on Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS). Please note that the resources of the cluster cannot be used for data processing and storage for the purpose of work on a particular research project, each service should present value to a wider research community.

In the early phases, the platform will build on existing strengths and integrate services already in development by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. In parallel, a number of external pathfinder projects will be identified for the purpose of technology development. In the future, the goal is to formulate a specific set of requirements and an application procedure for services to be hosted on the SciLifeLab Data Platform.

### Mission

The ambition of the platform is to provide a strong IT environment allowing to significantly boost available services for data-driven life science research in Sweden. Special attention will be paid to enabling compute-intensive and large data volume services which would otherwise not be offered. We see the SciLifeLab Data Platform as the environment in which users (researchers, bioinformaticians, software engineers, healthcare professionals, industry partners, etc.), life science data (from research projects, from data-producing infrastructures, from data sharing platforms, etc.), and e-Infrastructure (specifically, national computing and storage infrastructures for research) meet and interface with each other. Where possible, the ambition is to create strong connections with national e-infrastructure in Sweden and international toolsets and databases such as those mainted by the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). These efforts will be driven in collaboration and consultation with the research community and local university efforts, both within specific fields of research that are our priority areas and life scientists in general.

### Integration into the SciLifeLab Data Platform

Open science and open source values are at the core of the SciLifeLab Data Platform. The development and integration of each tool hosted on the platform should be guided by community input, data hosted on the platform is expected to meet a minimum level of FAIRness, be as open as possible as closed as necessary, based on privacy, legal, and ethical concerns. External tools and databases adhering to these principles are welcome to get in touch with the Data Centre to discuss hosting and/or collaboration possibilities. We especially welcome local initiatives that would like to broaden their userbase to the national level and community-driven projects.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss collaboration or hosting your tool or data on the platform, send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se.

The *SciLifeLab Data Platform* is a technical environment for hosting data-centric tools and databases as well as an overarching web portal with the goal to support and accelerate life science research in Sweden.

The SciLifeLab Data Platform will be comprised of services aimed at both researchers and data-producing facilities. The services hosted will be in alignment with; the Wallenberg National Program on Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS), the FAIR principles, Open Research and Open Source as well as good data management practises throughout the data lifecycle.

The SciLifeLab Data Platform is built and maintained by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data) and partners. Community-created content and services will also be able to integrate into the platform environment provided that the goal is to make data-centric tools and databases widely available.

The data platform is primarily funded and steered by [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) and the [Wallenberg National Program on Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven).

In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse and recognition of material made available on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. On this page, you will find information about how to cite the platform when reusing and referencing the content. Please note that the information on the platform is updated continuously, therefore it is important to refer to specific versions (or to provide access dates) within citations.

## Research community

In this section, you'll find instructions on how to cite the platform website, or underlying code, in research publications.

### Citing website content

##### Research Resource Identifier for the SciLifeLab Data Platform

The Resource Identification Portal was created in support of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rrids.org/">Resource Identification Initiative</a>. It aims to promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of research resources. Research Resource Identifiers (**RRIDs**) are persistent and unique identifiers for referencing a research resource.

The RRID for the SciLifeLab Data Platform is [SCR_024865](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_024865/resolver?q%3DSCR_024865%26l%3DSCR_024865%26i%3Drrid:scr_024865&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708614001299624&usg=AOvVaw1_8yog7sL5c9Da1PW625JZ).

By citing the platform using the RRID, you will facilitate further reuse of the platform, enable us to track any that activity, and allow others to easily find the _Summary Report_ for usage of the SciLifeLab Data Platform.

##### APA format

For official guidance see the [SciCrunch page on RRID citations](https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/guidelines).

**In-text citation**: Scilifelab Data Platform, SciLifeLab Data Centre, _version number_, RRID: SCR_024865. (Access date: date of access).

**Reference list**: SciLifeLab Data Platform (_access date_), SciLifeLab Data Centre, version (version number) from https://data.scilifelab.se, RRID:SCR_024865.

You will find the version of the platform at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/data.scilifelab.se">Github repository</a> under 'releases'.

If you are aiming to cite particular pages of the platform in particular (e.g. the Data Highlights), you may find that an author is mentioned and a date is given. In this case, you should include the appropriate date and author instead, but must still include the RRID. If information is given on how to cite something featured on a given page, then that citation should be used instead.

### Citing underlying code

The platform is operated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. All of the source code used on the website is available on GitHub. The code used to produce the website is available in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/data.scilifelab.se">Github repository</a>. All of the code that we have produced is available for reuse under an MIT licence.

##### APA format

## Journalists

Journalists are welcome to reuse images, content, or other material from the **Scilifelab Data Platform** for articles, blogs, social media etc., provided that the platform is acknowledged. Please refer to the platform as the **Scilifelab Data Platform** and link to our webpage <https://data.scilifelab.se> when you use content from the platform. You may also include our RRID: **SCR_024865** (see above for information on RRIDs).

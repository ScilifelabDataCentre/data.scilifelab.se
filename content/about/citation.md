In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse of material made available on the SciLifeLab Data Platform. On this page, you will find information about how to cite the platform when reusing/referencing the content. Please note that the information on the platform is updated continuously, therefore it is important to refer to specific versions (or to provide access dates) within citations.

## Research community

In this section, you'll find instructions on how to cite the platform website, or underlying code, in reearch publications.

### Citing website content

##### Research Resource Identifier for the SciLifeLab data Platform

The Resource Identification Portal was created in support of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rrids.org/">Resource Identification Initiative</a>. It aims to promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of research resources. Research Resource Identifiers (**RRIDs**) are persistent and unique identifiers for referencing a research resource.

The RRID for the SciLifeLab Data Platform is **SCR_024865**.

By citing the platform using the RRID, you will facilitate further reuse of the platform, enable us to track any that activity, and allow others to easily find the _Summary Report_ for usage of the SciLifeLab Data Platform.

##### APA format

**In-text citation**: The data was made available on the Scilifelab Data Platform (RRID: SCR_024865) (year)

**Reference list** SciLifeLab Data Centre (year). Scilifelab Data Platform, version (version number) from <https://data.scilifelab.se>, RRID:SCR_024865.

You will find the version of the platform at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/data.scilifelab.se">Github repository</a> under 'releases'.

If you are aiming to cite particular pages of the platform in particular (e.g. the Data Highlights), you may find that an author is mentioned and a date is given. In this case, you should include the appropriate date and author instead, but must still include the RRID.

### Citing underlying code

From the start, the Platform has been operated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. All of the source code used on the website is available on GitHub. The code used to produce the website is available in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/data.scilifelab.se">Github repository</a>. All of the code that we have produced is available for reuse under an MIT licence.

##### APA format

SciLifeLab Data Centre (year) data.scilifelab.se, version: (version number), DOI: (insert version DOI shown on the badge in the README.md file of our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/data.scilifelab.se">Github repository</a>). An example of the bedge is below:

## Journalists

Journalists are welcome to reuse images, content, or other material from the **SScilifelab Data Platform** for articles, blogs, social media etc., provided that the platform is acknowledged. Please refer to the platform as the **Scilifelab Data Platform** and link to our webpage <https://data.scilifelab.se> when you use content from the platform. You may also include our RRID: **SCR_024865** (see above for information on RRIDs).

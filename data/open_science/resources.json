This is achieved by advocating for practices like open access, reproducibility, and citizen engagement, and supporting these efforts with initiatives and infrastructures such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and OpenAIRE. EOSC provides a federated infrastructure for sharing and accessing research data across Europe, while OpenAIRE supports open science by enabling open access to publications, linking research outputs, and facilitating compliance with EU open science policies.",

    "description": "The Swedish Research Council (Vetenskaprådet) produced a Vision and Guiding Principles for Open Access to Research Data. This outlines a national strategy to ensure publicly funded research data is made “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, with the goal of fully implementing the transition to open access by 2026. The recommendations emphasise coordinated efforts among researchers, institutions, and funders to integrate open data practices, develop incentives, and enhance usability. This is achieved through standardised frameworks, infrastructure, and FAIR data management planning, while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations. Further details on Sweden’s approach to open science, including policies on open access to publications, research data, and broader open science initiatives, can be found on the Open access to research data - Swedish Research Council page. This platform serves as a resource for national recommendations and guidelines, that support Sweden’s transition towards open and FAIR research practices, as well as development in Sweden.",

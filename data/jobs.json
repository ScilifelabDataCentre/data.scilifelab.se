It is used in diverse applications to predict outcomes from inputs by training models to minimize prediction error in training data. As widespread adoption reaches beyond research and the development of such systems, guarantees for accuracy, reliability and safety become critical. State-of-the-art models which achieve top accuracy on benchmark tasks routinely fail to generalize to new examples even in strongly related problem domains. In this project, we will study the intersection of causal inference and machine learning using auxiliary information to improve the sample-efficiency and domain generalization of learning algorithms.<br><br>Generalization in machine learning refers to a trained system performing well on previously unseen examples. When analyzing and developing learning algorithms, unseen examples are often assumed to follow the same distribution as training examples. However, real data often follows different patterns: 1) The distribution of testing (in-deployment) examples often differs from those collected for training, 2) We often have access to different information or variables at training time than we do when the trained system is deployed, 3) The number of samples is rarely as large as we would like it to be. One example of this is classification of medical images using deep neural networks, where training sets are often limited in size but rich in annotations which are not available when the trained system is used.<br><br>In this project, we will develop sample-efficient learning algorithms which makes the best possible use of small numbers of training examples by exploiting auxiliary information and causal analysis.

The data will be used to train large-scale AI models to study cellular responses and make predictions for cell fate.<br><br>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing  wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques."

            "description": "In this position, you will develop statistical and machine learning approaches to analyze and improve modelling of disordered regions of macromolecular atomic models derived from multi-dataset X-ray crystallography experiments. Working with both national and international experimental collaborators, you will apply these methods to study the role of flexibility and dynamics in relation to molecular recognition and function using data from time-resolved, multi-temperature and fragment screening crystallography experiments.<br><br>As a PhD student, you devote most of your time to doctoral studies and the research projects of which you are part. Your work may also include teaching or other departmental duties, up to a maximum of 20% of full-time."

In some sub-projects, we study the evolutionary relationship between resistance genes in environmental bacteria and pathogens, and search for new forms of resistance in different environments using both bioinformatic methods as well different large-scale functional screens. We also study how analyses of resistant bacteria in sewage can inform predictions of the local, clinical resistance situation. A better knowledge about all these processes and drives will be valuable to be assess and respond to threats to our health.

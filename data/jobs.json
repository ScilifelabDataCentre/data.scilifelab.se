It consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated widefield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking, spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. With the AI-powered control software, data are analyzed in real-time, augmented views are added on the fly. By generating feedback control signals to control the microscope, the software will automatically change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells."

            "description": "Machine learning is now an essential tool for scientists and engineers. It is used in diverse applications to predict outcomes from inputs by training models to minimize prediction error in training data. As widespread adoption reaches beyond research and the development of such systems, guarantees for accuracy, reliability and safety become critical. State-of-the-art models which achieve top accuracy on benchmark tasks routinely fail to generalize to new examples even in strongly related problem domains. In this project, we will study the intersection of causal inference and machine learning using auxiliary information to improve the sample-efficiency and domain generalization of learning algorithms.<br><br>Generalization in machine learning refers to a trained system performing well on previously unseen examples. When analyzing and developing learning algorithms, unseen examples are often assumed to follow the same distribution as training examples. However, real data often follows different patterns: 1) The distribution of testing (in-deployment) examples often differs from those collected for training, 2) We often have access to different information or variables at training time than we do when the trained system is deployed, 3) The number of samples is rarely as large as we would like it to be. One example of this is classification of medical images using deep neural networks, where training sets are often limited in size but rich in annotations which are not available when the trained system is used.<br><br>In this project, we will develop sample-efficient learning algorithms which makes the best possible use of small numbers of training examples by exploiting auxiliary information and causal analysis. We will apply these algorithms in, among other tasks, medical image classification."

The position is open to computational scientists with an interest in microbial (meta)genomic data analysis.<br><br>Microbes produce a wide array of secondary metabolites (SMs), which allow them to interact with their environment, as well as with each other. The postdoctoral project proposed here will involve developing (meta)genome mining approaches, which can be used to identify novel microbial SMs involved in microbe-host and/or microbe-microbe interactions. The tools developed here will be applied to large amounts of microbial (meta)genomic data, with the goal of identifying microbial SMs responsible for host disease phenotypes (e.g., microbiome-associated cancers) or SMs with novel antimicrobial activities."

PREDICT är en precisionsmedicinplattform med etiskt godkännande för att hjälpa biobanksgivare med ett förnyat, modernt informerat samtycke för att koppla biobanksdata till journaler.

Hanteringen av känsliga personuppgifter regleras av den allmänna dataskyddsförordningen (GDPR), vilket gör det svårt att dela och återvinna biobanksdata. För optimal användning av biobanksdata syftar detta projekt till att utveckla maskininlärningsmetoder för dataanonymisering och utvärdering av anonymiserade biomedicinska data baserat på datakvalitet och risk för återidentifiering, vilket möjliggör datadelning och återvinning utan begränsningar av GDPR."

With the advent of massive datasets, the last two decades were dedicated to improve the mathematical modeling and training processes.

Among the recently developed solutions, federated machine learning (FedML) has proven to be a suitable approach for privacy-preserving machine learning. <br><br> The main objective of federated machine learning is to train a global machine learning model based on data that is distributed across heterogeneous data providers, but without requiring the raw data to leave the local data provider. While the FedML paradigm has been shown to preserve confidentiality of the data between the local data providers and the global model aggregator, there are still open challenges in ensuring that the training process is secure and private against malicious data providers, as well as to monitor the integrity of the training process without having access to the local data. <br><br> In this project, our focus will be on security and privacy-enhancing techniques for federated machine learning. The approach is centered around developing new theories and methodologies to achieve secure aggregation of federated machine learning models."

Recently, a deep learning method that can predict the structure of most proteins was made freely available, and a database with predicted structure was released. However, proteins do not act alone - they act together with other proteins. Therefore, the next major challenge is to use these types of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions. Initial studies from us have shown that it is possible to predict accurate structures of a large part of dimeric proteins using either a modified version of AlphaFold2 or AlphaFold-multimer. However, there are still many proteins that cannot be built accurately, nor are we able always to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs and to build larger complexes accurately is still an unsolved problem. In this project, we are recruiting 1-2 PhD students which will work together with two recently recruited postdocs to leverage recent advances in the field of machine learning to build better deep-learning models for predicting protein-protein interactions and to apply these methods to biologically relevant problems. <br><br> The Elofsson group is located at the Science for Life Laboratory. Elofsson has worked on protein structure predictions for more than two decades. He has worked on various techniques, both using machine learning and other computational techniques. His most important contributions for this work are the methods he has developed to identify the quality of protein models, Pcons and various versions of ProQ.

            "description": "Because of privacy concerns around user data, and related legislation around handling user data, there has been an increased interest in using edge devices such as mobile phones, to process user data without storing them at a central location. This has also been a major concern in privacy-sensitive areas such as in medical applications of machine learning, where sharing patient data between hospitals raises privacy issues since patient data virtually always contain private information. There has therefore been much interest lately in federated learning, a class of optimization algorithms used mainly to train a global machine learning model at disparate heterogeneous sites without sharing data between the sites. It is possible to frame federated learning as an operator splitting problem, and within the operator splitting framework, it is possible to simultaneously solve many of the problems that arise when training large-scale machine learning models on e.g., medical images or other data from multiple sites."

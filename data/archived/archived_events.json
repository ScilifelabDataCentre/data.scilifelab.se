The link between digital health, omics technologies, artificial intelligence and data means that yet more collaboration is required to ensure the success of precision medicine. As demonstrated by organisations such as SciLifeLab, the collaborative efforts of healthcare, research, industry and patient organisations is really starting to bear fruit.<br><br>The lines between the different disciplines involved in precision medicine are often blurred, so to bring all of the people together we have created three unique meetings which allow our attendees to move freely between different areas of interest.<br><br>Through a combination of keynotes, presentations, panel discussions, breakouts and networking opportunities, you will have access to those who are shaping the digital health revolutions across the region, under one roof, over two days.<br><br>Placing all the experts from the Precision Medicine ecosystem in one place at one time allows for the very essence of what many say is the key to precision medicine – collaboration"

            "description": "One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis (e.g. bioinformatics or computational biology) have often suffered from incomplete method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially prevents any possibility of reproducing the results of such studies. The term “reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea that a scientific publication should be distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof."

We will be discussing the different types of identifiers available, their importance in creating FAIR Digital Objects, and how they can be applied and integrated into research practices. Speakers include Maggie Hellström, Peter Wittenberg, Matthew Buys, and moderated by Natasha Simons, Nabil Ksibi, Patricia Herterich.<br><br>The events will bring together speakers from the RDA Groups and speakers from a related EOSC service to describe how their work aligns, how it connects to the research community, and how it benefits the research community in a way that is directly related to the implementation of FAIR and Open research practices. The events are beginner-friendly, laid-back, and easy to follow, with moderators driving the discussion, posing questions to our speakers, and inviting audience questions. Finally a selection of questions will be gathered and turned into Google Educational Q&A flashcards (https://schema.org/QAPage) for future reference."

The meeting is aimed to be a broad meeting on every aspect of evolutionary biology of all forms of life on Earth. However, please note that the meeting is restricted to scientists active in Swedish academic departments.<br><br>This year the Evolution in Sweden conference is organized together with the Evolution and Biodiversity research area from the Data-driven life science program (DDLS), part of a 12-year SEK 3.1 billion initiative from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. We encourage researchers working with analysis of large data sets in the fields of evolution and biodiversity to attend."

As it spread across the globe, the pandemic posed significant challenges for society, governmental bodies, healthcare systems, and research communities. Unprecedented efforts were necessary to  generate, handle, and report the sheer amount of complex data required to be able to understand how SARS-CoV-2 was spreading, and develop efficient policies to fight the pandemic. SciLifeLab Data Centre, ELIXIR Norway and ELIXIR Estonia have organised an online event exploring how Nordic countries handled omics data related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We invite bioinformaticians, data stewards, research scientists, and anyone else interested in this topic to attend. We will focus in particular on how sequencing efforts were coordinated, how data was managed and shared, and how data was used and communicated to different groups. We will also discuss the importance of the FAIR principles in pandemic data management, and which tools and pipelines facilitated efforts. We hope that this will shed light on best practices that could be adopted across the Nordics for future pandemics, and how we might best prepare for them. We also hope to identify key resources that have wider applicability and can be reused further."

            "description": "This symposium aims to bring together experts from various fields with the explicit goal of outlining a joint worldwide strategy to obtain a structural map of the human proteome. In addition to determining the structure and composition of all human proteins and their interactions, it would also require understanding the flexible and dynamic supra-molecular structures in living cells, such as multi-component membraneless organelles. A few key findings from the last years make us believe that this goal is achievable. First, detailed knowledge of composition (splice forms, PTMs) and expression levels in different cells are becoming available. Secondly, Cryo-EM has revolutionized the structural determination of large protein complexes. Finally, using co-evolution and advances in deep learning, it is now possible to predict the structure of many individual proteins and complexes directly using no other information than the sequences and their evolutionary history. In the next few years, combining the progress in these three areas will provide an opportunity to provide unprecedented molecular insights into the function of cells. Theoretical methods combined with ever-increasing sequence information will enable an understanding sequence and structural variation within populations, both in humans and in disease-causing organisms."

The meeting was held in Uppsala 2014, Lund 2016, Stockholm 2018, and Gothenburg 2020. The host for 2023 is Evolutionary Biology Centre, at Uppsala University. The meeting is aimed to be a broad meeting on every aspect of evolutionary biology of all forms of life on Earth. However, please note that the meeting is restricted to scientists active in Swedish academic departments.<br><br>This year the Evolution in Sweden conference is organized together with the Evolution and Biodiversity research area from the Data-driven life science program (DDLS), part of a 12-year SEK 3.1 billion initiative from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. We encourage researchers working with analysis of large data sets in the fields of evolution and biodiversity to attend."

The event is organised and hosted by NBIS and SciLifeLab with an invited speaker and Senior UX Designer from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).<br><br>The webinar aims to highlight some of the basic principles of User Experience (UX) Design, to demonstrate how they provide value in the development process and to guide participants to resources for adopting UX Design practices in their own projects. While the intended audience is NBIS and SciLifeLab staff the registration is open to everyone interested in developing web applications and services for life science research. Registration is required to receive instructions and connection details for the event."

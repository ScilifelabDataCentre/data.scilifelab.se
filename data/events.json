Published research based on computational analysis (e.g. bioinformatics or computational biology) have often suffered from incomplete method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially prevents any possibility of reproducing the results of such studies. The term “reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea that a scientific publication should be distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof."

After 20 years as a research group leader and director of the SNP&SEQ Technology Platform, followed by five years as senior professor at Uppsala University, she retired in 2022. This open symposium brings together her former colleagues from Finland, as well as coworkers and former students in Uppsala to celebrate the progress in Human Genomics during the past three decades and future prospects for Genomics in Precision Medicine."
